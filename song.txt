Oasis - Little By Little
We the people fight for our existence
We don't claim to be perfect but we're free
We dream our dreams alone with no resistance
Fading like the stars we wish to be
You know I didn't mean what I just said
But my God woke up on the wrong side of his bed
And it just don't matter now
As little by little we gave you everything you ever dreamed of
